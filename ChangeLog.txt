playlist tab only does, playlist stuff
channel browser tab handles channel stuff.
channel tab right now allows for listing videos, shorts, and live streams
playlist and channel tab have filters for urls to try to make sure only valid playlist / channel urls are allowed. strange, unfortunate things can happen if they're not.

added a very basic bookmark system for channels. creates a config folder in XDG config location (typically ~/.config) called ytdlpfrontend and a sql database file ytdlpf-bookmarks.db
saves channel name and url
bookmarks also are automatically alphabetically sorted for that fine organization
v0.38
redid the bookmarks to be a table list rather than a dropdown menu
v0.39
added the ability to store output directories for bookmarks
v0.40
added a new context menu (dropdown menu) in channel browser to let users select if they want to pull every single video the channel has for their selected content type, or limit the amount to 500, 100, 5, or 1 if they just want to pull the latest and greatest video the channel uploaded.
v0.41
added the ability for bookmarks to save output directory format, filename format, and subdirectory along with output directory location.
v0.42
went ahead and set embed chapters, embed json information, add metadata, embed thumbnail, sponsorblock, and block sponsors to enabled by default. i figure they are sane enough people will probably also have them enabled. of course, they can be turned off by the user.
v0.43
for the channel browser tab, made it that if you check mark a video, it will automatically enable "use selected items for download"
v0.44
tied channel browser video download to list: context menu. helps speed up downloads from channels that has enormous amount of videos if you limit the amount of videos to list. before, download didn't take list: context menu into consideration, so even if you limited the list, say to 100, download pulled down the ENTIRE list to search for the video url to download. now if you limit to, say, 100, download will only pull down 100 to find the url for the video id / title to download that was selected.
v0.45
added the ability to save list: context menu values to bookmarks. to help not forget to limit certain channels that have enormous amounts of videos.
v0.46
added the ability to list videos in the channel browser tab to show upload dates. but its ridiculously slow due to yt-dlp slow processing.
v0.47
added a nifty video list display that displays the amount of videos being listed
v0.48
that nifty video list display, showed a bug that i didn't know existed. sometimes, list triggers, twice. so if list was set to 50, it would trigger twice and display 100 videos... so its fixed now.
v0.49
added a new bookmark option to save video formatting options
